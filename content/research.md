## Research

Overall, my research project aims to facilitate and improve software development. 
For this, I am interested in the **development of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages** which have shown their effectiveness in the world of software development, thanks to a set of features such as abstraction, verification, code generation and many others.
More specifically, **my research aims to provide languages and tools to model, verify and ease software development of heterogeneous distributed systems like Cloud Computing.**

My research interests include:

- ***Model-Driven Engineering***
- ***Software Language Engineering***
- ***Reverse-Engineering***
- ***Model Verification & Validation***
- ***REST APIs***
- and ***Cloud Computing***
